# MetaMesh
an Ethereum framework for community self-governance, funding, and implementation of collectively-owned public utilities, specifically wireless mesh networks


The goal of MetaMesh is to support the continuous addition of mesh nodes and the expansion of community interest in the project while staying true to the group's founding philosophy of community-owned, content neutral, low-cost Internet for all.

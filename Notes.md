## 1.1 Network Infrastructures
> Traditionally telecom services
and access to the Internet were seen as an option,  a luxury for corporations and the club of those
citizens willing to pay premium to benefit from these artificial “superpowers”...  
 growing adoption of data networks as the best, and sometimes the only, option to communicate with many other people and access most information, has promoted that access to an essential (sometimes called “universal”) service.  (7)

Today connectivity is essential, yet is still provided primarily by profit-oriented corporations with little incentive to be inclusive:

> The deployment and operation of these networks and services requires investments that feature large economies of scale in urban areas with many citizens (customers)...  
As the population density decreases and the distance to major cities increases or the economic capacity of customers decreases, the margin for commercial exploitation decreases or becomes negative. However, there is growing consensus that it is important to provide these services to every citizen, in particular in remote areas that are generally under-served... (8)

If "Web 3.0" is going to decentralize the Internet it must address the problem of relying on Internet Service Providers (ISPs) which can act as gatekeepers preventing many communities from enjoying reliable connectivity.

## 1.2 Community Networks
> Crowdsourced computer networks are network infrastructures built by citizens and organisations who pool their resources and coordinate their efforts.  The coverage of under-served areas and the fight against the digital divide are the most frequent driving factors for their deployment... (10)

This may be the case for mesh networks which provide Internet access to computers with no other available connections, but it is not true for crowdsourced computer networks (including blockchain protocols such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as applications built on top of them) which depend upon an Internet connection to maintain continuous synchronization. In practice, running a full node requires a high-speed connection with unlimited data, which typically means relying on ISPs.

> CNs are a subset of crowdsourced networks that is characterised by being
_open_, _free_, and _neutral_.
They are open because everyone has the right to know how they are built.  They are free because the network access is driven by the non-discriminatory principle; thus they are universal.  And they are
neutral because:  
a)  Any available technical solution may be used to extend the network;  
b)  The network can be used to transmit data of any kind by any participant, for any purpose. (10)  

## 2.1 Principles

**Non-discriminatory and open access**  
**Open participation**

## 2.2 Network Infrastructures as Common Pool Resources
> According to Ostrom, a CPR typically consists of a core resource that provides a limited quantity of extractable fringe units.  In our case, the core resource is the network, which is nurtured by the network segments the participants deploy to reach the network or to improve it.  The fringe unit is the connectivity participants obtain. Resilient CPRs require effective governance institutions to keep a long-term direction and deal with the struggle to handle many actors and changes in a complex system.  The long-term direction is defined as sustainability in remaining productive or operational under the fundamental principles of the CPR, and the short-term goal is defined as adaptability in reacting and adapting to change. (13)

Ethereum also fits this definition of Common Pool Resources. Tools like Boardroom could address the governance needs of a mesh network. Could mesh networking solve any of Ethereum's sustainability / adaptability / inclusivity issues?

# NYC Mesh Meetup - July 11, 2017

## Things slowing us down
- outreach
- installs

## Outreach
- leaflet by Lisa meshnyc.net/leaflet
- create outreach package
- share with landlords

## Installs
#### Alex is an independent contractor doing installations
- $160 per installation ($50 to Alex)
- 2-3 hour job, could be done by one person

### Install planner volunteer needed!
- manage spreadsheet, emails, etc
- coordinate with nodes

#### New node requests
- Join form -> spreadsheet -> map
- Spreadsheet drives entire project

_Ron: Slack board is lacking a way to get to know other members, maybe we need a page for member bios?_

#### Types of installs:
- Supernode-1 client: usually connects from a window (EdgePoint R6)
- 2nd hop install: 2 hops from supernode (NanoStation with mesh firmware or fast 802.11ac router)
- Kiosk repeater node: to install, aim at a Link NYC kiosk (use it as another Internet gateway, or even as a way to VPN across the city to the supernode)
- Rooftop to rooftop: most of these installs have failed... (only works with a reliable gateway, multiple apartments in a building, and tenant is guaranteed to stay long-term)

Slides available on nycmesh.net/blog/presentations

## Julian:
- An opportunity for the community to get hands-on with recreating the Internet, which most of us take for granted
- From a human point of view there is a lot of communication and organization that goes into building the network
- Supernode is meant to provide stability to an otherwise fragile network
- Wiki shouldn't be THE wiki, should be replicated across the network

## Biggest barriers to growing the mesh
- As mesh grows, will need more tech support (Ron is very interested)
- Educate and train mesh members
- Organize workshops, meetups, neighborhood initiatives

There is a form to sign up for attending an installation (on the Meetup page)

Martina: Community project to bring Internet to Governor's Island, which currently has no access
- Very well aligned with NYC Mesh mission
- For $500/month they could put another supernode on the other side of the building
- Mostly a funding problem, would also require coordination with institutional tenants
- Should be a professional job with reliable public wifi connections.
